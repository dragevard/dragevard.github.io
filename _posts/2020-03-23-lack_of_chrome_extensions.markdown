I feel browser extensions are often overlooked or unknown to many people who surf the web. To this day, I am suprised by how many of my family and peers in college does not know about browser extensions. It baffles me to think that someone surfed the web using the vanilla browser in this decade. I first discovered browser extensions back in elementary school. When I was watching videos and got tired of ads interrupting my session whether it is the beginning or middle of the video. One day, I got curious and Googled "ad block". The first result from the search directed me to an Ad Block extension for Firefox, which is my browser of choice at the time. From there on, I discovered many other useful extensions that makes my browsing experience better like Video DownloadHelper and Skip Redirect. 

When Chrome was beginning to gain popularity, I refused to change factions because of the lack of community support in their extension market. It is like having an iPhone, but without any Apps for the platform. Now that many of my favorite Firefox extensions are ported over to Chrome, I swap over to Chrome because of its marketshare and it is the preferred browser for software developers.

Disappointingly, I do not have Chrome installed on my Android phone. I have Firefox on my phone. Why? Chrome on mobile does not support extensions, when extensions are in basically in every mobile browsers. The good news is that Chrome extensions are supported; supported by browser that is not Chrome. Which baffles me because the browser does not support their own extensions; whereas, an outside browser does. The Kiwi Browser app supports Chrome extensions, but I did not use it because that is not Chrome and Firefox in my opinion is better because Firefox have many customization options and extensions. Which is why I hope that by learning software engineering, I could develop many of my favorite extensions from Firefox for Chrome or possibly help port them over.
