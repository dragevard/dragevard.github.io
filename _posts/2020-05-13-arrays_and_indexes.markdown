Arrays are a collection of object/data. Every element inside an array are ordered by their respective index. The index is based on the order of the element inside the array, beginning with an index of 0. Element inside an array can also be called with negative indexing. Negative indexing starts from the end of the array to the beginning and starts with an index of -1. Negative indexing is useful for quickly accessing elements at the end of an array, especially in cases in which you don't know the length of the array and you want to just access the last element.


Arrays can be created explicitly and implicity. 

- Explicit: array = Array.new

- Implicit: array = []
