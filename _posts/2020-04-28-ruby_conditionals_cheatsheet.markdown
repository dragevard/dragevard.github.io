Ruby conditionals are created by the key word *if*. The *if* statements are used to add logic into your programs. This makes the program more complex and exert behaviors based on whether or not the specified conditions were met. Multiple conditional statements can be created, but with different key words: *elsif* and *else*. *elsif* statements are created after an *if* statement is present and the *else* statement is created after *elsif*. The program will move from the *if * statement to the *elsif* statement if the *if* conditions are not made and on to the *else* statements if *elsif* conditions are not met. Thus the hierachy of these conditional statements is *if* > *elsif* > *else*. Only one block of code will execute meaning the first applicable block of code's condition is met. Only that code block will run and the program will ignore the rest of the conditional statements.
